# Rails-Auth-Base

## Purpose
This is a very basic Ruby on Rails app with authentication mechanisms. 
It can be forked to generate your own RoR app which needs authentication. It 
was heavily inspired by [Simple Authentication in Rail 4 Using Bcrypt ](https://gist.github.com/thebucknerlife/10090014)
